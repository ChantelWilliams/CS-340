•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
 
 To ensure I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable I always make sure to use descriptive names for variables and functions as well as write clear and concise comments  to explain my code. 

•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I like to approach problems by breaking them down into smaller more manageable pieces. When I do this, it allows me to focus on specific aspects of the problem and identify potential solutions. While working on Grazioso Salvare's request for a database and dashboard, I approached the problem by first analyzing the requirements and identifying the key data entities and relationships. From there, I designed a database that met their UI/UX requirements and supported their customers needs. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists use their knowledge of technology and computing systems to innovate solutions and solve problems. The work of a computer scientist matters because technology is rapidly changing, and companies need computer scientists to keep up with digital demand. My work on this type of project would help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better because I would be able to create a database and dashboard that would help them manage their animal shelter more effectively.
